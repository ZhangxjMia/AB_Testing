    "# Website Translation - Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Company XYZ is a worldwide e-commerce site with localized versions of the site. A data scientist at XYZ noticed that **Spain-based users have a much higher conversion rate than any other Spanish-speaking country**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spain and LatAm country manager suggested that one reason could be translation. All Spanish-speaking countries had the same translation of the site which was written by a Spaniard. Therefore, they agreed to try a test where each country would have its own translation written by a local. That is, Argentinian users would see a translation written by an Argentinian, Mexican users written by a Mexican and so on. Obviously, nothing would change for users from Spain.\n",
    "\n",
    "After they run the test however, they are really surprised because the test is negative. That is, it appears that the non-highly localized translation was doing better!"

    "## Problem to be solved\n",
    "1. *Confirm* that test is actually negative. i.e., the old version of the site with just one translation across Spain and LatAm performs better\n",
    "2. *Explain* why that might be happening. Are the localized translations really worse?\n",
    "3. If you identified what was wrong, *design an algorithm* that would return FALSE if the same problem is happening in the future and TRUE if everything is good and results can be trusted."

    "A key assumption of the A/B test is that the only difference between the treatment group and the control group is the feature we are testing, which means that the treatment group and the control group are comparable in user distribution. If this is true, then we can accurately estimate the impact of feature changes on any metrics of our experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparability: The user distribution of the treatment group and the control group means that for each relevant market, the relative proportions of users in the treatment group and the control group are similar, that is, if the US users are 10% of the users in the treatment, We hope that the proportion of American users in the control group is 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a statistical point of view, the above situation is correct among enough users. In the a/b test, we are looking for a very small gain, so the sample size needs to be as large as possible to ensure that the distribution of the treatment group and the control group are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, before performing statistical tests, it is extremely important to check whether the distribution of the treatment group and the control group are similar."
